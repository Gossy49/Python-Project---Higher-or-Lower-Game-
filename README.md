# Higher or Lower Game (Followers)

A simple Python console game where the player guesses which option (A or B) has more followers.

## How the game works
- The program shows two options: A and B.
- Each option represents a person or brand and includes:
  - name
  - description (for example: celebrity, shop/brand)
  - country
- The player types `A` or `B` to guess who has more followers.
- If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues.
- If the guess is wrong, the game ends and the final score is shown.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
